Perhaps the most significant benefit of server-side code is that it allows you to tailor website content for individual users. Dynamic sites can highlight content that is more relevant based on user preferences and habits. It can also make sites easier to use by storing personal preferences and information â€” for example reusing stored credit card details to streamline subsequent payments. It can even allow interaction with users of the site, sending notifications and updates via email or through other channels. All of these capabilities enable much deeper engagement with users.",picture:"backend",links:[{title:"MDN: Backend",link:"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Introduction",icon:"mdi-information",external:!0},{title:"Django: Backend",link:"https://www.djangoproject.com/",icon:"mdi-information",external:!0}]},{title:"Cluster & Microservices",description:"Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
